        I am a <a href="https://www.usenix.org/publications/login-logout/november-2013-login-logout/night-watch">systems</a> software engineer and researcher.
        I am interested in the art of computer systems design and implementation.
        Recently, my focus is on building datacenter software infrastructure for emerging cloud and AI use cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was fortunate enough to have research experiences from EPFL and the University
        of Chicago. Before that, I finished my master's degree from 
        <a href="https://systems.ethz.ch/">ETH ZÃ¼rich</a> and bachelor's degree from
        <a href="http://en.hit.edu.cn/">Harbin Institute of Technology</a>.
